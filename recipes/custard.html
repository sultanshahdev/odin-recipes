            A Delicious Fruit Custard
        </h3>
        <p>
            Custard is a culinary preparation made by blending eggs with milk or cream. Custard is thickened by the coagulation of the egg proteins, which is achieved by gently heating the custard in some way.

            How to make a Custard Step-by-step
        </h4>
        <ol>
             <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Place milk, vanilla extract, and butter in a saucepan.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Cook and stir over medium heat until simmering; remove from heat before it comes to a boil.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Whisk eggs, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl until sugar dissolves.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Set the saucepan back over low heat. Pour in egg mixture slowly, whisking constantly, until custard thickens enough to coat the bottom of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve warm or transfer custard into a large bowl and cover.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow to cool before chilling. Enjoy!
